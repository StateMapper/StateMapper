*This software is a PHP/MySQL rewrite/redesign of [Kaos155](https://github.com/Ingobernable/kaos155/) developped by the same [Ingoberlab](https://hacklab.ingobernable.net/) team. It aims at providing a browser of all the world's public bulletins' data, and altogether analyze how bribery has been hiding through history.*

## Manifest:

Official bulletins are a mess: unpublished or in unstructured manner, lots of plain text to read, no browser. And this is a key point to hide public bribary. StateMapper is born short after project Kaos155 has been uncovered, [... to be continued/replaced]


## Installation:

Please refer to [the Installation guide](documentation/guides/INSTALL.md#top).


## Contribute:

If you like this software and its goals, there surely are many ways you can get involved!

The project's current workforce splits into three commissions:

| Commission | Responsability |
| ----- | ------ |
| Counter-bribery Strategists | in charge of the project's strategy and communication |
| Core Wizards | in charge of improving the core code |
| Schema Soldiers | in charge of implementing bulletin schemas |
| Country Ambassadors | in charge of hosting bulletins' IPFS nodes |

.. and any of the following would help us all a lot!

**Map yet another bulletin!** You're a JS/json/regexp developer? Help us by implementing a missing bulletin of your choice. It can be from whichever country, region or city, the goal being to get interesting information out!

**Improve our code!** You're a PHP/MySQL developer? Push us some core code improvements or bugfixes! Come to our team meetings if you wish.

**Translate to a new language!** Thanks to [PoEdit](https://poedit.net/), it is really easy to translate StateMapper to whatever language you speak. And it can really help the project to spread!

**Share this project!** and tell everyone how it can help us out with the world's dramatic public bribery situation.

**Donate to us**, coming to the [Ingobernable](https://ingobernable.net) and asking for the Kaos team :)
