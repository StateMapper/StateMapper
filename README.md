*This software is a PHP/MySQL rewrite/redesign of [Kaos155](https://github.com/Ingobernable/kaos155/), developped by the same [Ingoberlab](https://hacklab.ingobernable.net/) team. It aims at providing a browser of all the world's public bulletins' data, and altogether analyze how bribery has been hiding through history.*

## Manifest:

Official bulletins are a mess: unpublished or in unstructured manner, lots of plain text to read, no browser. And this is a key point to hide public bribary. StateMapper is born short after project Kaos155 has been uncovered, [... to be continued/replaced]

Please refer to the [Installation guide](documentation/guides/INSTALL.md#top).
