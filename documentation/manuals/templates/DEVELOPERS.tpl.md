## Workflow:

The processing layers can be described as follows:

| Layer name | Responsability |
| -------- | ---- |
| daemon | start and stop bulletin spiders |
| spider | trigger workers to fetch, parse and extract bulletins |
| parse | parse bulletins and trigger subsequent fetches (follows) |
| fetch | download bulletins from bulletin providers |
| extract | extract precepts and status from parsed objects |
| controller + api | route calls and prepare data for the templates |

- The daemon throws spiders (one per type of bulletin), which throw workers (one per day and type of bulletin). 
- Workers call the parser (parse layer), which call the fetcher (fetch layer) every time it needs (once for the daily summary, and often many times more for sub-documents).
- Then the workers, if configured to, can call the extractor (extract layer) on the parsed object to convert it to *entities* (*institutions*, *companies* and *people*), *precepts* (small texts) and *statuses* (tiny pieces of information). 
- The controller and api layers are only here to route HTTP and CLI calls to the frontend GUI, and to each processing layer separately.

## Extraction:

The extraction layer is where data is finally saved to the database in the form of very small pieces of information (called *status*), linked to their original text (called *precept*). During this step, several tables are filled:

| Table | Content |
| ---- | ----- |
| precepts | original text to extract information from |
| statuses | single, small information about one or several entities |
| entities | legal actors; currently of three types: *person*, *company* and *institution* |
| amounts | amounts related with the status, with units and USD values |
| locations | locations related with the status |

Status are sorted by ```type``` and ```action``` as follows:

| Status type | Action | Meaning | Arguments |
| ---- | ----- | ----- | ---- |
| name | new | company foundation | note: the company name |
| name | update | name change | target_id: the new entity |
| name | end | company dissolution | | |
| administrator | start | start as an administrator | target_id: the administering entity |
| ... | | | |

Here is an overview of the database tables:

## Tips & tricks:

* If you ever need to hide yourself when pushing changes, we recommend you create a Github user with a dedicated mailbox from [RiseUp](https://account.riseup.net/user/new) or [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/signup). Also, we recommend you also use RiseUp's [VPN Red](https://riseup.net/en/vpn). To do so, follow [these instructions](https://riseup.net/en/vpn/vpn-red/linux).

* When developping and fetching lots of bulletins, sometimes you won't have enough space on your local disk.
To move everything to a new disk, we recommend using the following command:

```bash
rsync -arv --size-only /path/to/statemapper/data/ /path/to/your/external_disk/statemapper/data
```

Then modify the ```DATA_PATH``` in ```config.php```.

* To delete all files from a specific extension (say .pdf), use the following:

```bash
find /path/to/statemapper/data/ -name "*.pdf" -type f -delete
```

* If needed, please edit Github manuals from ```documentation/manuals/templates``` and ```documentation/manuals/parts```, then compile them to ```documentation/manuals``` with ```smap compile``` (before commiting). The root ```README.md``` can be edited directly from the root folder.
* To read/edit ```documentation/classes_diagram.dia```, you may use [Dia](http://dia-installer.de/download/linux.html): ```sudo apt-get install dia```
* In general, you may use "?stop=1" to stop auto-refreshing (the rewind map, for example), and be able to edit the DOM/CSS more easily.
* In general, you may use "?human=1" to format a raw JSON output for humans.
* The main logo was made using the [Nasalization font](../../src/assets/font/nasalization) and the [FontAwesome](http://fontawesome.io/icons/)'s "map-signs" icon.
* Favicons can be generated from FontAwesome icons through [this page](https://paulferrett.com/fontawesome-favicon/) or [this one](https://gauger.io/fonticon/).
